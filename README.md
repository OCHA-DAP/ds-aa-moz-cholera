# Mozambique AA for Cholera Analysis

This repository supports the analytical work on Anticipatory Action (AA) for cholera in Mozambique. It focuses on evaluating and exploring thresholds outlined in the national cholera preparedness and response plan, with the aim of informing timely early actions.

## Objectives

- Analyze the applicability and robustness of cholera thresholds defined in the national plan.
- Explore historical and near-real-time outbreak data to identify potential triggers for anticipatory action/early action.

## Data Sources

The analysis relies on data hosted in a secure Azure Blob Storage environment. Due to data sensitivity and confidentiality, this repository and its associated data cannot be made publicly available. Access is restricted to authorized collaborators.

## Structure

- `analysis/` – Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and threshold analysis.
- `src/` – Supporting scripts for data processing and visualization.
- `docs/` – Internal documentation on methodology and findings.

## Requirements

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
